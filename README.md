# No Whitepaper

We like to keep things simple, you don’t need to read large and boring whitepapers you don’t understand, let’s be honest, which was the last Whitepaper you really fully read?

# No Whitelist

No tedious whitelist process, you dont need to send us any of your personal information, anyway you never know what ICOs do with your personal information and documents, they say they delete it but who knows?!

# No Roadmap

We don’t want to be like all the ICO’s out there, they have a Roadmaps but they never meet deadlines , so a Roadmap doesn’t make sense for this token, the only thing we plan to do is to keep adding it to new exchanges.

# 100% Tradeable

TTK is a standard ERC20 token, so you can hold it and transfer it. We will keep adding it to new exchanges so you can easily buy or sell tokens.
